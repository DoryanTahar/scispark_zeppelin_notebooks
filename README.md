# SciSpark Notebooks
SciSpark is a scalable scientific processing platform that makes interactive computation and exploration possible. This prototype project outlines the architecture of the scientific RDD (SRDD), and a library of linear algebra and geospatial operations. SciSpark's frontend interface leverages notebook software and is built on Apache Zeppelin. 
This repo provisions examples of SciSpark usecases within the frontend interface and provides tutorial series on how to use the SciSpark API within the frontend.

## Getting Started
Apache Zeppelin and the jar of the SciSpark code is required for these notebooks. We suggest grabbing the [SciSpark full stack docker image](https://github.com/SciSpark/docker-scispark-zeppelin). Once the notebook interface is running, you can import the notebook directly from this GitHub repository. To do this, choose the **Import note** from the SciSpark notebook interface and use the URL to the raw file in GitHub.
