For now, we have added a temporary fix to allow notebooks that generate large JSON files to be imported by Zeppelin. This will likely be fixed in the future by using an version of JSON.

1. Download and untar Zeppelin 0.5.6 at https://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/download.html. Do NOT install the binary files as the main instructions say to do.
2. cd into your installation of Zeppelin and then cd zeppelin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/server
3. In line 170 of ZeppelinServer.java, add a 0 to the end of the number listed there.
4. Follow the instructions to build at https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/README.md
   In particular, you should ensure that you install node.js. On a mac this can be done with "brew install node".
   Then run "mvn clean package -DskipTests"
5. Now, you can start Zeppelin as follows:
   bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start
