# SciSpark Notebooks - Tutorial series
These notebooks provide a tutorial series on how to use SciSpark via the frontend interface. 

## Getting Started
Apache Zeppelin and the jar of the SciSpark code is required for these notebooks. We suggest grabbing the [SciSpark full stack docker image](https://github.com/SciSpark/docker-scispark-zeppelin). Once the notebook interface is running, you can import the notebook directly from this GitHub repository. To do this, choose the **Import note** from the SciSpark notebook interface and use the URL to the raw file in GitHub.
